# Quick start

Parabox relies on a **client** to work in conjunction with a **plugin**. You need to have both the client and the plugin installed on the device. When using FCM to connect, you can choose to install only the client.

## Download and install

Go to [Official Website](https://parabox.ojhdt.dev/), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ojhdtapp.parabox) or [Github Releases](https://github.com/Parabox-App/Parabox/releases) to download the latest version of the client.

## General startup process

1. Install the client and plugin
2. Follow the plug-in prompts to start the plug-in
3. Go back to the client, click the avatar to open the status check dialog, and check whether the plug-in connection status is displayed as `âœ“`. Status checks can also be performed in the settings page.
4. If the connection fails, please return to the plug-in to check the operation. If the cause of the plug-in is ruled out, please try to kill the client process and try to start it again. If the plugin provides the `auto-login` function, it is recommended to enable this function, kill the client and the plugin process and try again.

## Next steps
Check if the plugin provides the `autologin` feature. If provided, it is recommended to enable this function, which can greatly improve the connection stability.
